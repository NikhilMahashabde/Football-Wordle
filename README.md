# Features

Soccer wordle uses a different set of rules as compared to the original wordle games. Due to the difficulty of the game, the ruleset was modified to accept any string of letters as this constitutes a fair guess. The base game will alter users to correct letters and partially correct letters. Upon successfull guess of the player name, the game is reset.

* Fully functional Wordle game that generates a random player name from a database of over 15,000 profiles. 
* Friendly on every monitor size from low-budget mobiles to ultra-wide monitors. Dynamic scaling to ensure readibility and functionality.
* Fully functional buttons as well as keyboard input accepted. 
* Pop up instructions on first site load. Pop up help available on click of help button.
* Settings pop up, which allows for the user to change difficulities (number of attempts)
* Points and Gem based scoring systems which rewards guessing correct letters, and correct words, with bonuses awarded for timely completion
* Resetable and allows users to give up
* Upon win/loss/give up, a brief player information summary is presented for educational purposes 
* Local storage of user profile, which includes default name, points and gems balance
* Functionality to add monetisation (i.e. purchase of points which can be redeemed for hints)

# Technologies Used
Why you used the technologies you used,

* HTML5 - Used as a backbone to the website. This is an mandatory requirement for webpages. Many Bootstrap templates, sections, headers, footers have been organised using HTML rather than generated by Javascript (JS).

* CSS - Vanilla CSS was used during the initial construction of the site, but later phased out to Bootstrap. The main grid for guess' continues to use vanilla CSS grid and styling. 
  
* Bootstrap 5.0 - The primary purpose of was to enable the use of Modal forms (pop up windows). As a mobile first approach was used, a smaller screen size limited space available on the page, hence the use of Modals would allow for extra menu options such as hints, settings, displays etc. Due to the overwhelingmly positive impact of bootstrap on the layout and visual appear, over time, almost the entire application was converterd to use modal templates over vanilla CSS.
  
* Javascript/ES6 was used for dynamic functionality of the site. Various functions within JS are impleneted, 
   * Variables, loops, functions
   * Async data import 
     * FIFA23 database used to extract player information to XML file,
     * Amending all diacritics to standard english letters via excel VBA. 
     * Converting XLSM file to JSON file format 
     * Hosted it onto gitHub
     * Called into soccerWordle by function to import on start up.
  * Local storage object was used to store user profiles
  * Function used to create profile "objects". 
  * Timer function to display stopwatch, as well as implement feature to add gems on "quick" wins.
